For keywords add multiple sentences and have a rand int decide which to concatinate with the google description.

Must Add:

If a query resutls do not match any of our keywords, our cause will not be supported
Here's an idea: how about if we don't get any matches, we add a suggestion with a word starting with the same letter?
Ex: search query "zippers"
We would add:
Did you mean "zebra?"

How easy would something like this be to implement?
